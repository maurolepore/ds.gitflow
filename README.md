A series of meetups about the gitflow workflow.

## Syllabus

The goal is to learn when and how to use the gitflow workflow as
automatically as possible.

At the end of this series you will be able to do things like these:

* Understand when to prefer the gitflow workflow over the simpler GitHub
workflow.

* Setup a project to use `git flow`.

* Start and finish different kinds of branches -- for features, hotfixes,
and releases.

Each item in this syllabus corresponds to a meetup and a GitHub
[release](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/ds.gitflow/releases)
that preserves a snapshot of this repository exactly as it was shown
during thee meetup.
